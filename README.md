## Hi there ðŸ˜Š

#### Welcome to my space of codes, tests and games.

I've been working more than 13 years on innovation and technology products. Here are some of the projects I made to practice and play with new things. More professional infos on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thallesbastos/en) and [portfolio](https://thbastos.com/).

## Check out my last experiments

<p>Space Invaders is a classic game that you should be able to find at any retro-based arcade. Surprisingly, coding it with JavaScript isn't that difficult, we just need to know few concepts regarding image rendering, physics, and object interaction. <a href="https://thbastos.github.io/space-invaders/" target="_blank">Play demo ></a></p>

<p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method for students, perfectionists, and procrastinators of all kinds. Work in focused, 25-minute intervals. Here we have a customizable timer to practice pomodoro. <a href="https://github.com/ThBastos/diversifica-pomodoro" target="_blank">Check repo ></a></p>
